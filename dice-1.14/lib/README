			COMPILING LINK LIBRARIES FROM SDOURCE

				(AMIGA)

   You can use the library source to compile additional DICE link libraries
   that were not shipped on the original disks but you must have a great deal
   of hard disk space and ram in order to be able to do this.

   There is a certain amount of setup you will have to do before you can
   use dmake to compile this library source.

   * If you are running under 1.3 you have to change the 'Set' commands in
     the DMakefile to 'SetEnv' commands.

   * You need to assign XDLIB: to where the destination (where to create the
     libraries).  You usually do not assign this to DLIB: so as not to
     overwrite your original libraries immediately.

   * Needless to say, you can't compile 3.0 libraries without the 3.0 includes.

   * There are literally dozens of memory model variations, a full compile
     of all libraries with all memory model variations requires over 7MB of
     hard disk space just to store the objects and another 7MB to store 
     the .LIB files themselves.  A full compile takes several hours on an
     A3000!
