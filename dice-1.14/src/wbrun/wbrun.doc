WBRun is a program designed to allow any program to be invoked from CLI yet
behave as if it were invoked from Workbench.  Note that workbench need not
be loaded!  This is a boon for people who are short on memory and do not
wish the extra overhead of workbench.

This permits running programs created with AmigaBasic and TrueBasic (or
any other application that creates a workbench project icon) from CLI
as either a turnkey application or even in a startup-sequence.

To invoke a program with WBRun you need to execute the command:
  WBRun <icon1> <icon2> ...

Where <icon1> is the primary program to be run.  The name must correspond
to a workbench Icon.  <icon2> and subsequent parameters are taken as 
workbench arguments to be passed to the primary program.

For example:
   To run Initialize:
      WBRun SYS:System/Initialize

   To run a program (call it Printit) that takes arguments (normally shift
   clicked on) you would type
      WBRun Printit Arg1 Arg2

To run an AmigaBasic Program:
  WBRun myprogram

Note that the arguments must be qualified if they are not in the current
directory.

Supressing the Copyright message:
  If you are building a turnkey application that you do not wish to have
display the WBRun copyright message, you may supress it with the CLI
redirection features:
   WBRun >NIL: MyApplication

If you do this, you must give credit to the Software Distillery in your
application.

Known Bugs:
  None so far...

How it works:
  WBRun simulates a phoney workbench by building an argument list of the
locks and names corresponding to the command line arguments.  It then opens
up the disk object for the first argument to determine the tool type.  For
a TOOL it simply invokes that program, for a Project it determines the
default tool to be invoked.  Once the program to be invoked is determined,
it does a LoadSeg on it, CreateProc and sends the startup message to the
newly created task.  Finally it waits for the response message from the
task before terminating.  All resources allocated are freed upon completion
or any error.

The code is written completely in Lattice C under 5.02 taking advantage
of Blink and CBack.  Without messages to make it user friendly it is a
shade over 2K, the messages and minimal IO support raise it to 4956 bytes.
Note that all this is done without making any serious attempts at optimization.
