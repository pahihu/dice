    support common blocks

    * Jump table fails / retry ?  Does this cause non-reentrancy
      problems that I forgot about ?

    * if no DATA section then __DATA_BAS made BSS !  causes problems
      with startup code but can't fix because relocation code
      would access illegal memory (since no BSS image)
