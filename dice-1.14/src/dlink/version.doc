    DLINK
	2.06.10
	    Fixedup -E option / error messages imported from dice.errors
	    Ident changed to Commodore style

	2.06.09
	    Handles LINE debug hunks

	2.06.08
	    Fixed exiting-with-0 bug even when errors reported.

	2.06.07
	    fixed byte branch to external label, was calculated
	    incorrectly (went one too far)

	    fixed 8 bit relocation, was taking offset as unsigned

	2.06.06
	    Added check for illegal small-data references to far objects,
	    generates error message.

	2.06.05 :
	    Fixed bug in 2.06.04 memory reuse.

	2.06.04 :
	    Revamped reusability of memory.  DLink takes about 15% less
	    memory now.

	2.06.03 :
	    Bug in zalloc() found, relocation arrays larger than 4K
	    (1024 entries) would trash memory.  fixed!

	2.06.02 :
	2.05.02 :

	    -ma and -mw support (relocate for absolute long and absolute
	    word addressing modes where the final data base address is
	    hardwired)

	    support for -pr and -pi options (to generate an executable
	    containing a single hunk, both residentable and non-residentable
	    versions)

	    Fixed random-memory-read bug (did not effect linking, but would
	    sometimes read random memory that happened to be the custom
	    chip area, causing screen glitches and other problems)

	    Better error reporting.
