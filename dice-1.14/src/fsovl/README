				FSOVL-HANDLER

    This is a filesystem overlay handler that provides automatic compression
    and decompression of files.  Openning a file automatically decompresses
    it.  Writing to a file automatically compresses it.  Files openned for
    read are blocked into memory in 4K segments while files openned for
    write are brought entirely into memory and then compressed on close.

    Seek operations are fast but an actual Read() after a seek may be slow.

    Files with extensions of .Z .LHA .LZH .ZOO .ZIP are not compressed.

    The first 8 bytes of the comment field of a file is reserved to store
    its actual length.  This is transparent for operations done through the
    FSOVL-HANDLER.
