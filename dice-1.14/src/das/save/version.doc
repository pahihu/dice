	.09	Consolodated -dDEBUG/dbprintf stuff
		Consolodated error stuff
		Ident changed to commodore style

	.08	Added DEBUG hunk stuff with 'debug' pseudoop

		debug	<linenumber>

	.07	fixed bug in Bxx.b (explicit byte branch), would
		generate error previously.  Didn't show up because
		compiler uses Bxx with no extension and allows the
		assembler to optimize it.

		now returns proper exit code on error.

	.06	fixed bug in JSR->BSR optimization, would disallow
		JSR (A0) case.  oops.

	.05	added JSR->BSR optimization and BSR.W->BSR.B optimization
		finally fixed -E option

	.04	fixed bug in EXG.. EXG As,Ad would be output Ds,Dd ..
		oops!  screws up -mRR option to DC1.

	.03	fixed confusion with labels that begin like a register,
		such as 'D0X'

	.02	now removes link instruction even if subroutine call is made.
		Since the link occurs after registers are saved it was useless
		anyway (as far as maintaining a frame pointer even when no
		local stack is required).

	.01	First release
