    do defered structures work ?
    what about embedded structs ?
    uword - uword comparison failure!



    -------

    genmisc - TF_REGCALL handling of procedure assignments !



    fuu[i] /= 3;    fuu char ary - failsq
    char /= x;	fails...

    double d1,d2 d1 % d2 -- better error message (blockopt struct?)

    bitfields:	a += b; where a is a bit field.
    bitfields:	error msg on &bitfield

    optimize if (const-exp), while (0), for (; 0;) ... watch out for
    goto labels inside though.

    STRUCTURAL RETURNS	:   Use slightly different naming convension for
			    subroutines that return structures so no mistake
			    is made.  For such subroutines a pointer to
			    the destination must be supplied.

	s_<label>	    routine returning a structure

	p_<label>	    prototyped routine when treated differently from
			    normal routine


    goto labels -> must put in different domain than variables

    auto initialization of auto arrays and things.
