    NOTE: removed Refs in favor of DiceHelp, but if make another PD
    release should put them back in (see defs.h)

    opens console device but doesn't close it?

    autotime <interval> <command>

    menu spacing due to font size!

    * incorporate REXX.C.MMW into REXX.C

    * $fname, $fpath should determine actual file name and path.

:Constructive criticism of DME 1.38.
:
:- when moving the cursor rapidly down the screen, the scrolling lags behind the
:  cursor so that it continues to scroll after you release the button. This is
:  very annoying! (In Interlace mode, this is)
:
:- The ARP requestors have two small problems. The current (or last) path is
:  not displayed in the DIR gadget when the requestor is opened, and couldn't
:  you put the volume names alongside the device names in the VOLUMES listing?
:  (like: DF0:Workbench1.3
:	  DF1:TextFiles
:	  RAM:scratch
:	  etc..)
:
:- And (finally, but my biggest gripe!) is the block mark facility. I like being
:  able to mark a whole line with two keypresses, BUT couldn't you include a
:  character marker too, so that small portions of lines could be cut/copied, as
:  well as whole lines? What about a UN*X-like CHR-WORD-LINE-PARA multi-step
:  marking system? I'm sure that would be possible. What about if I was to
:  attempt to implement this myself? (I would be better doing it in Assembly
:  than C, but I am learning C so it would be a good project for me!) Would you
:  be interested in the modifications? Or has someone else already done this?
:
:OTHERWISE, thanks a bunch for the brilliant code you keep producing. I don't
:know where I'd be without DMouse (Just downloaded the latest version today),
:and I have only used DME for a couple of months now, but I like it a lot! Your
:shell was great too, but I have moved on to ARP now!
:
:Keep up the good work!
