	2.06.27
	    Now warns when nested comments found

	2.06.26
	    Fixed line number synchronization bug related to initial
	    creation of precompiled include file.

	2.06.24
	    Consolodated Error line output and debugging
	    Ident changed to commodore style

	2.06.23
	    Fixed bug with spaces/tabs after directive (before comment),
	    related to string replace that would include said info *in*
	    the string when it shouldn't

	2.06.22
	    Fixed bug in line number tracking relating to concatenated
	    lines

	    Fixed bug relating to spaces in macro arguments

	2.06.21
	    Fixed bug with precompiled includes where error messages would
	    always be relative to the first .c file that generated the
	    precompiled include.

	2.06.20
	    Fixed bug in calculation of hex constants

	    Fixed bug in >> operator

	    Fixed bug in precompiled includes, parts of constants (such as
	    0x23) were being symbolized.  Also fixed bug relating to
	    parts of constants being misinterpreted as symbols.

	2.06.19 :
	    Fixed bug in parsing of octal constants '\xxx'

	2.06.18 :
	    Fixed #define fubar(a,b) then using fubar alone (i.e. like
	    a variable)

	2.06.17 :
	    Stringize direction, embedded \n, as in quoteme(fubar\n) was
	    improperly stringtized... it now shows up as "fubar\n" which
	    is, I believe, what it should be.

	    comments in macro args as in MACRO(foo /* , */, bar) would
	    cause errors if embedded special chars exist.

	2.06.16 :
	    Handles # directive (null directive)

	2.06.15 :
	    fixed symbol-replacement problems for symbols that are
	    in character strings, i.e. #define fubar(x) "x x x" would
	    replace the x's in the string, which is wrong.

	2.06.14 :
	    fixed stringtize operator '#define fubar(x) #x'

	    unterminated string errors no longer repeat the error
	    message a thousand times.

	    Added C++'s // comments to preprocessor.

	2.05.13 :
	    allows -DMACRO(x)=DEF style command line defines, before
	    it would only allow simple defines.

	2.05.12 :
	    fixed /*/, was thought to be the entire comment when
	    actually it is equivalent to only /* ... /**/ is the
	    minimum comment.

	2.05.10 :
	    fixed multiple ## ops, i.e. a ## b ## c

	2.05.09 :
	    fixed error message when initial file not found

	2.05.08 :
	    cpp has always appended # <line> commands to inform main compiler
	    of appropriate place in source.  This screws up when an #include
	    file is included without a final 'newline' at the end!

	2.05.07 :
	    fixed dumb bug.. macro expansion failed if open paren on next line
	    from macro symbol (for macro that takes args)

	    #undef sym /* this comment screws up the undef */  fixed...

	2.05.06 :
	    -U	added (undef default defs)

	    fixed file-not-found error message

	    #line <lineno> "filename"   directive added
