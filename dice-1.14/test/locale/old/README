Hi, Matt.

Here are two programs, howing two different methods.  The first is
helloworld.c,  modified to show use of external strings as well as internal.

the MSG_ defines will be defined automatically by DICE, during
its 'make .cd file pass'.  You're going to have to have such a pass, to
give the user a chance to remove strings that should not be localized.

Then, something is going to have to take that .cd file, and order the
strings according to the MSG_ defines.	I'm using catcomp to do this.

We need to have those defines at some point;  those defines are the
relationship between the strings built into the program and the strings
in the catalog.


The idea of reading all the strings from the catalog directly to make
the dice string table (rather than use the block method above) has
two problems:  1) the IFF spec for the catalog file has not been
released/documented as far as I know.  and 2) the string numbers
are not contiguous.  So we can't just loop on a catalog in general
and pull the strings out.  If we remove the ability for the user to
specify message number ranges of his/her own, we can use GetCatalogStr()
for DICE to build its table.  (this is shown in hello.c).  But I don't
think the limitation is acceptable.
