    NOT IMPLEMENTED IN UNREGISTERED RELEASE BUT IMPLEMENTED IN REGISTERED
    RELEASE:

	* bit fields
	* floating point
	* manual pages for DICE libraries
	* keywords:	__chip, __far, __near
	* misc library routines

    PREPROCESSOR:

	token-pasting operator (##) resolves the paste last instead of
	first.	Thus, the pasted operator may not currently be used to
	represent other macros.

    MAIN COMPILER:

	Certain ANSIsms are not yet followed.  Specifically, arithmatic
	type promotion still follows the 'if any type is unsigned then cast
	both to unsigned'.  Under ANSI, if a larger signed type and smaller
	unsigned type is given, the unsigned type is cast to the larger
	signed type instead of both to unsigned.

	structural returns and auto-aggregate initialization are now in,
	hopefully bug free but if you find yourself having problems check
	these first.

	When a non-aligned structure is passed to a procedure, the
	__aligned storage qualifier will not work properly for that
	procedure or any procedure called from that procedure (on down...)

    LIBRARY ROUTINES

	time routines ignore daylight savings time.
