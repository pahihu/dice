Owner version 37.2 2/93
Usage: owner [0x | $]address [0x | $]address ...


Owner is used to find the "owner" of a RAM or ROM address.
Onwer can find the "owner" or status (free) if the address is in:

                Task Control Block
                Task Stack
                SegList
                Public Message Ports
                Messages on public ports
                tc_MemEntry
                FreeList
                ROM Modules

Version 37.2 of Owner adds "SegTracker" support.  If SegTracker
(now distributed with Enforcer) is running, owner can find the hunk
and offset of any address that's in any loaded code (process,
library, device, handler, etc.)

Owner can be used in conjunction with the "LVO" tool to find the
likely systen function containing any ROM address.  This is very
useful if you get an Enforcer hit or Mungwall hit or crash at
a ROM PC address.  Ose Owner to determine the ROM module
containing the adress, then give LVO the module name (example: intuition)
and the address (example: LVO intuition ROMADDRESS=0xnnnnnnnn)
