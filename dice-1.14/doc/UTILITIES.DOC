			     DICE SYSTEM UTILITIES
			      REGISTERED VERSION

	This is an overview of DICE utilities, please refer to individual
	manual pages for more information

	<wildcard> support exists for many commands.  This is an unanchored
	search and things like:     fubar/#?/#?  WILL WORK.


    dobj objfile_or_library [-o outfile]

	DOBJ disassembles object files and libraries.  There are no limitations
	to object or library file size.

    cat <wildcard>

	CAT types out one or more files as specified by the wildcard.  Startup
	is a bit slower than TYPE due to the directory scan.

    expand <wildcard>
    expand <fmt> <wildcard> ...

	EXPAND generates a list of files, one per line, using the specified
	<fmt> string (default "%s").  This allows you to generate repetetive
	command sequences on a large number of files efficiently.

	1> expand #?
	1> expand "fubar %s" #?

	If you wish to specify more than one wildcard you MUST supply a
	format.  For example:

	1> expand %s #?.c ram:#?

    libtos amiga.lib amigas.lib

	LIBTOS converts a large-data-model AMIGA.LIB into a small-data-model
	AMIGAS.LIB ... source is included in the LIB directory allowing
	modification to convert other libraries.

	A small-data model AMIGAS.LIB allows DICE to generate residentable
	code.

    makeproto -o outfile file1 file2 ... fileN

	MAKEPROTO is a cute utility to create a prototype file given a set
	of source files in a clean fashion, without relying on crazy compiler
	options.

	The idea is to create a DEFS.H file that all your source files include
	with all the stuff you normally stick in such a file plus the following
	defines:

	#define Prototype   extern
	#define Local	    static  /*	or as nothing at all */

	Each file prototypes functions declared in that file, for example:

	Prototype int x;
	Prototype void FuBar(int);

	int x;
	/* etc...   */


	You then create a PROTOS.H file by running MAKEPROTO on all source
	files.	This file should be #include'd by DEFS.H .  MAKEPROTO simply
	extracts all lines beginning with 'Prototype' into the specified
	output file.

    dsearch "string" <wildcard>

	Searches for the specified string in the specified files.  Quite fast.
	Search is case insensitive.

    head <wildcard>

	Prints the first 10 lines of each specified file.

    wc <wildcard>

	counts characters, words, and lines in each specified file and
	prints a total at the very end.

    dupdate <files and options>

	used to create distributions, in general copies some source tree
	to some destination tree, but only necessary files to bring the
	destination up to par.	Has other features.

    autorefs outfile <wildcard>

	Used to generate DME.REFS files from .H files, AUTODOC files, and
	other manual pages.

	'outfile' is always appended to so if you are re-generating a
	refs file you should first delete it.  files in <wildcard> are
	scanned, with .H recognized as header files and others as
	document files.

    du path

	DU stands for DISK-USAGE, and reports the aproximate number of
	blocks in a directory tree.  It tries to figure out the number
	of blocks files actually take up by adding a fudge factor for
	side sectors, and it's pretty close, but not perfect.

    dprof proffile

	DPROF is a program profiler.  When you compile a program with the
	-prof option it will generate a binary data file on exit. The DPROF
	program interprets this .dprof file and displays the profile in
	formatted text.
