SYNOPSIS
    FDTOLIB files/wildcard.fd [-h hdrfile] -o libname [-mr] [-mD] <more_opts)

    files/wildcard.fd	specifies one or more files and/or AmigaDOS
			wildcarding that represents the .FD files that
			are to be processed into a library

    -h hdrfile		hdrfile is a .H files that #include's all
			prototypes associated with the FD files.  It
			is only used if the -mr option is specified

    -o libname		specify output library name

    -mr 		specify that a REGISTERED call interface library
			is to be generated (for DICE -m[r,R,RR] options),
			else generates a normal stack-args interface
			library.

    -mD 		specify large-data model, else small-data model

    -I include-dir	passed to DCC

    -p prefix		Set prefix (currently only for standard generation,
			doesn't work with -mr).  The default is a single
			unscore.  This option is normally used to generate
			_hyper_ tags for dynamic.library

    -prof		Generate profiling code for the tags.  This will
			cause all library calls to be profiled when the
			program that links with this library is run.

    -auto library	Generate auto-init code for library after the
			tags.  <library> in this case is the name of
			the shared library.  For example, -auto fubar.library

    -AUTO library	Generate ONLY auto-init code for library (do
			not generate tags)

DESCRIPTION

    FDTOLIB will create an amiga standard library out of specified .FD
    files (for example, you can generate most of amiga.lib by using
    the .FD files on your 1.3 Extras disk).

    Basically, FDTOLIB will generate one of four types of libraries:

	default     small-data model
	-mD	    large-data model
	-mr	    small-data model + DICE registered parameters entry pts
	-mr -mD     large-data model + DICE registered parameters entry pts

    If -mr is used suitable prototypes must be specified with the -h option.
    In this case, FDTOLIB will run DCC with a special option to have it
    generate a register-specification file for it to match up again the
    FD files.

    FDTOLIB then proceeds to scan the .FD files, creating temporary
    assembly files in T: and assembling them with DAS, then appending
    them to the output library and deleting the scratch files.	This
    step occurs for each function in each .FD files.

    (For faster operation, you will want to make DAS resident for the
    duration)

    If -mr was specified, FDTOLIB only generates library entries for
    those routines for which a prototype exists.  At the end of the
    run FDTOLIB will report any routines which existed in the .FD files
    but did not have a prototype.
