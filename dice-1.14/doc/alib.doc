   NAME
	_DOSBase auto-open

   SYNOPSIS

   FUNCTION
	If the _DOSBase base variable is referenced (i.e. extern) but not
	declared then _DOSBase will be automatically declared in the doslib
	module of auto.lib.  Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the
	autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that automatically
	opens "dos.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

	If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
	ever called.

	The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
	the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
	so.

   NOTE
	_DOSBase is normally openned this way for most programs since parts
	of c.a are normally reference that make dos calls.  In fact, all
	programs that use the main() entry point since c.lib's _main()
	entry point references DOS.

   NAME
	_GFXBase auto-open

   SYNOPSIS

   FUNCTION
	If the _GFXBase base variable is referenced (i.e. extern) but not
	declared then _GFXBase will be automatically declared in the gfxlib
	module of auto.lib.  Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the
	autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that automatically
	opens "graphics.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

	If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
	ever called.

	The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
	the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
	so.

   NOTE
	Programs that use this auto-open feature by simply calling graphics
	library functions without bothering to declare or open the library
	will only compile under DICE.  When compiled with other compilers a
	link error will occur since the linker will not be able to find any
	declared storage for the base variable, only references.

   EXAMPLE
	/*
	 *  Example program which just calls a graphics.library function
	 *  without bothering to open the library.
	 */

	main()
	{
	    WaitTOF();
	}

   NAME
	_MathIeeeDoubBasBase auto-open

   SYNOPSIS

   FUNCTION
	If the _MathIeeeDoubBasBase base variable is referenced (i.e.
	extern) but not declared then _MathIeeeDoubBasBase will be
	automatically declared in the ieeelib module of auto.lib.
	Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the autoinit and autoexit
	sequences called by c.a that automatically opens
	"mathieeedoubbas.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

	If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
	ever called.

	The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
	the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
	so.

   NOTE
	DICE uses the autoinit feature to automatically open and close
	floating point libraries that are indirectly referenced by
	fp operations.

   EXAMPLE
	#include <stdlib.h>

	main()
	{
	    double d;

	    d = atof("1.234");
	}

   SYNOPSIS

   FUNCTION
	If the _MathIeeeDoubTransBase base variable is referenced (i.e.
	extern) but not declared then _MathIeeeDoubTransBase will be
	automatically declared in the ieeetranlib module of auto.lib.
	Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the autoinit and autoexit

	"mathieeedoubtrans.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

	If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is

   SYNOPSIS

   FUNCTION
	If the _IntuitionBase base variable is referenced (i.e. extern) but

	the intlib module of auto.lib. Additionally, auto.lib adds routines
	to the autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that
	automatically opens "intuition.library" before _main and
