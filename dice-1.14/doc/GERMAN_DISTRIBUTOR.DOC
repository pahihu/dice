			 German Distributor

			       for

		    Matt Dillon's C-Compiler DICE

For us german users it is very difficult and costly to send the registration
fee ($50) to the US. Now there is an address for DICE registration in Germany.
Registrations for other european countries are available on request.

	     Stefan Becker
	     Holsteinstrasse 9
	5100 Aachen
	     Germany

The registration fee is 85 Deutsche Mark (or an aquivalent sum in your local
currency). This includes one free update. Every additional update costs 10
Deutsche Mark. You have three choices for the money transfer:

   1.) Cash
   2.) Cheque (payable to "Stefan Becker")
   3.) Direct transfer onto the following bank account:

	 Stefan Becker
	 No. 6048474
	 Stadtsparkasse Aachen
	 BLZ 390 500 00 (Germany)
	 Usage: DICE
	 PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR NAME ON THE TRANSFER ORDER!!!

Every order in cash will be processed immediately, cheques and money transfers
will be delayed until the money has been cashed to the account.

To order your free update, just send me a note. For user who are already
registered in the US, I will contact Matt to check if they haven't used their
free update yet. To cut down the flood of update orders, every registered DICE
user is allowed to copy the newest version from another registered DICE user.
