LHEX 40.5  LHA/LZH archive extraction Utility
=============================================
Freely redistributable

Changes:

LHEX 40.5 should now abort when it encounters a compression table it
doesn't understand or which is corrupt, rather than potentially
crashing.

LHEX 40.4 gets rid of the "cannot extract" complaint
when extracting empty directories.

LHEX 40.3 uses a SAS option to get a 20000 stack for itself
if it finds itself running with a smaller stack.  I do not know how
deep an archive this will cover, but a default 4000 stack definitely
wasn't enough for this Unix source code.

Bugs: Does not extract file comments
      Error messages say "LhA: ..." as in original Unix sources
