    DUPDATE dist-dir dest-dir	[FORCE][QUIET][NODEL] [DISTFILE distfilename]
    DUPDATE dist-file dest-dir	[FORCE][QUIET][NODEL] [DISTFILE distfilename]

    DUPDATE is a program that creates distributions.  It creates an exact
    duplicate of the source directory tree in the destination with
    modifications according to control files in the tree.  DUPDATE deletes
    files in the destination tree that do not exist in the source and updates
    files from the source into the destination tree that have been modified
    since the last dupdate (or copies them fresh if they do not exist).

    FORCE	- DUPDATE will not ask permission to copy a fresh file

    QUIET	- DUPDATE will not display verbose output

    NODEL	- DUPDATE will not delete files in the destination that do
		  not exist in the source.

    DISTFILE file
		- specify alternate control file that 'modifies' the
		  dist update, default is .DistFiles

    If a file ".DistFiles" exists in any directory of the source tree,
    updating of the destination is modified according to the file.  This
    is a text file which may specify additional files/directories to add to
    the destination directory (pulled from other random places), files and
    directories NOT to include in the destination tree, or a list of specific
    files to include (where files not listed are not included).

    By using the DISTFILE <file> option you can generate different
    distributions for different purposes all based in the same source tree.
    For example, I have a DISTFILE set to create the registered and
    non-registered DICE distributions and other DISTFILE files (using
    different names) to create the three floppies in the registered
    distribution.

    In the first format, if the ONLY keyword is specified after the first
    file name only these files / sub-directories will be included from this
    directory.	No other files will be copied

    --- DISTFILE FORMAT #1 (this line not included) ---
    file_or_dir_name	ONLY
    file_or_dir_name
    file_or_dir_name
    file_or_dir_name
    file_or_dir_name
    --- END DISTFILE FORMAT #1 (this line not included) ---


    The second format allows files/directories to be made part of the
    destination tree that do not necessarily exist in the current directory.
    Additionally, specific files/directories that do exist in the current
    directory can be excluded.	Any file/dir not explicitly unincluded using
    the 'no' keyword will be copied.

    --- DISTFILE FORMAT #2 (this line not included) ---
    file_or_dir_path
    file_or_dir_path
    file_or_dir_path	no
    file_or_dir_path	no
    file_or_dir_path
    file_or_dir_path
    --- END DISTFILE FORMAT #2 (this line not included) ---
