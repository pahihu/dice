SYNOPSIS
    dsearch "string" [files/wildcards]
    qsearch "string" [files/wildcards]

DESCRIPTION
    The DSEARCH program will do a case-insensitive search for the
    specified string in the specified files.  Wildcarded file names
    may be specified.  DSEARCH prints out the name of each file
    scanned whether or not any matches are found in that file.

    QSEARCH works like DSEARCH but only prints out the name of files
    when matches are found within them.

    Both DSEARCH and QSEARCH are the *SAME* executable.  One can nominally
    COPY DSearch QSearch to obtain a 'qsearch'.
