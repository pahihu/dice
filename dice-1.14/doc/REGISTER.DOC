				REGISTER.DOC

    If you are currently using the FREEWARE version of DICE, you may want
    to register.

    Registration is $50 through 1992
    Registration will be $60 starting January 1 1993


    The registered DICE dist consists of:

	*   The DICE C compiler system, fully self contained system that
	    includes the full compiler, editor, utilities, commodore 1.3
	    AND 2.0 includes and amiga.lib, numerous example code, on-disk
	    documentation for most ANSI functions, and library source code
	    with the ability to reconstruct any library from scratch.

	*   An initial mailing of 3 disks.  I provide the disks.

	*   Future updates -- the first update is FREE but you must request
	    it specifically.  You are welcome to request a list of changes
	    up to the latest version to help you decide.

	    The second update and beyond costs $10 through 1992 and will
	    cost $15 beginning January 1993.

	*   When DICE goes commercial -- and it's going to happen,
	    registered users will be able to update to the commercial
	    release for the cost of the commercial release minus what they
	    have already paid for the registered release.  That is, it
	    doesn't hurt your upgrade path to register.  Note that when you
	    switch over to the commercial dist any pending free update will
	    be lost (i.e. not count).

	*   A commercial dist is in the works, there will be an announcement
	    when it is ready (guessing 4-6 months).

    The registered version does NOT contain:

	*   There is NO bound manual, documentation is on-disk.  The
	    registered distribution consists of 3 disks.

	*   The autodocs are NOT included (Commodore provides no license
	    to do so, the autodocs are commodore's disk-based amiga
	    documentation)

			    Additional Compiler Features

    The following features exist in the registered release and do not exist
    in the freeware (or net) release.

	*   automatic and explicit registerized procedure calls

	*   __chip and __geta4 storage qualifiers (__near, __far, __aligned,
	    and other keywords exist in both releaes).

	*   single and double precision floating point.  No quad precision
	    yet.  Direct 881/882 support is forthcomming but not ready yet.

	*   Manual pages for nearly all the ANSI functions (c*.lib).  Each
	    manual page includes a fully compilable example.

	*   Source to the c*.lib and other DICE link libraries including
	    the means to remake any library (though you need a lot of
	    HD space to recompile the link libraries).

	*   Access to registered updates.  First one free (on request),
	    after that at a low fee.  Updates are via SNail mail or BIX
	    and available to everyone.

	*   Bitfields

	*   020/030/881/882 support as I add it in.


			      HOW TO REGISTER

    U.S. ORDERS: To register for DICE from the U.S. send a check or money
    order to me (my address is at the bottom of this document). If you do
    not have a checking account note that you can obtain a money order from
    your local post office for a very low fee.	Cash is accepted and being
    U.S. mail would probably make it to me, but I strongly recommend a
    check or money order.

    CANADIAN ORDERS:  Canadians can obtain a CANADIAN POSTAL MONEY ORDER
    from their local post office drawn in U.S. funds (that's important! It
    must be drawn in U.S. funds!).  This costs very little and is the
    easiest way to register from Canada.  I CANNOT ACCEPT CHECKS DRAWN ON
    CANADIAN BANKS.

    INTERNATIONAL ORDERS:  To register for DICE from a foreign country you
    need to obtain an international money order drawn in U.S. funds. The
    international money order must have the address of a U.S. bank on the
    face.  Usually a foreign bank will have an account with an associate
    bank in the U.S. and be able to provide such money orders.	In some
    countries you can obtain an International Postal Money order from your
    post office for a smaller fee.  Note that international money orders
    can be costly.  You can also obtain U.S. currency and send that but
    there is no guarentee it will make it through the postal system.

    INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS:  There are several distributors of DICE
    through which you can register without having to deal with obtaining
    an international money order (which can be difficult and costly).

    Germany/Europe: Stephan Becker (see GERMAN_DISTRIBUTOR.DOC).  Direct
    bank transfer or EuroCheck (made out to Stefan), 85,- DM or equivalent.

	     Stefan Becker
	     Holsteinstrasse 9
	5100 Aachen
	     Germany

    Sweden: If you are a member of NPD you can register for DICE through
    them.

    DO NOT SEND EUROCHECKS TO ME.  To register with a EuroCheck you should
    go through Stefan Becker and make sure the check is made out in his
    name.

    YOU DO NOT NEED TO SEND ANY EXTRA MONEY FOR RETURN POSTAGE, POSTAGE
    IS INCLUDED IN THE REGISTRATION FEE.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO SEND DISKS,
    I PROVIDE THE DISKS -- THEY ARE PART OF THE REGISTRATION FEE AS WELL.

    due to unreadable addresses.

    INTERNATIONAL MONEY ORDER IS USUALLY INCOMPLETE.
