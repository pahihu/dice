    dcpp sourcefile [-o outfile] [-I includedir ...] <options>

    DCPP automatically scans DINCLUDE:, DINCLUDE:PD/, and DINCLUDE:AMIGA/ .
    Any -I option directories are searched in sequence BEFORE DCPP's
    default search path.  The last default directory, DINCLUDE:AMIGA/, may
    be modified with the -1.x and -2.x options, see below.

    Note that DINCLUDE:PD/ (added after version *.11) is meant to be a
    place to put public domain header files so as not to clutter the
    top level DINCLUDE: directory.

    As with all DCC commands, the space between the option and an
    associated file/dir argument is optional.

    DCPP probably does not implement everything perfectly and might fail on
    some constructions.

    DCC normally runs DCPP before DC1

				CPP.DOC

    The following symbols are defined by default

	mc68000 	    -running on a 68000

	_DCC		    -'DCC' compiler

	__STDC__	    -ANSI __STDC__

	AMIGA		    -AMIGA computer


			   Options to CPP

    -1.N
    -2.N
	    This option selects the OS.  If not specified, DCPP searches
	    dinclude:amiga for amiga includes.	If specified, DCPP searches
	    dinclude:amiga1N or dinclude:amiga2N for amiga includes
	    instead.

	    DCC supports this option and passes it along to dcpp.  This
	    allows developers to compile under either 1.3 or 2.0 (or
	    whatever) with the flick of an option.  DCC also uses a
	    different amiga.lib (see DCC docs).

    -d[#]
	    This option turns on DCPP debugging

    -o[ ]file
	    This option sets the output file, otherwise stdout is used.
	    the space is optional

    -ffp
	    Passed from DCC, tells preprocessor to define _FFP_FLOAT.
	    If not specified, preprocessor defines _SP_FLOAT.  This
	    exists to better support alternate floating point models
	    in header files.

    -D[ ]define[=stuff]
	    This option predefines a symbol or macro.

    -F file
	    specify stderr file, any errors are appended to the file
	    instead of to stdout.  Useful for batch compiles

    -U
	    This option undefines the following symbols:

		__STDC__
		mc68000
		_DCC
		AMIGA

    -H<precompoutfile>=<headerfile>

	Enable use/creation of precompiled header files.  Example:

	-Ht:defs.m=defs.h

	see DCC.DOC for more information.

    -I0
	    This option causes DCPP to *NOT* include any default
	    directories in the include search list.

    -I[ ]dir
	    This option adds the specified directory to the include search
	    list.  A hanging slash on the end of the path is not required.
	    The space is optional.

    -//
	    Enable C++ style // comments.  The remainder of the line after
	    // is encountered is interpreted as a comment.  This differs
	    from /* style commenting in that no explicit comment-terminator
	    is required.

    -notri
	    Disable tri-graph scan pass.  Note that the tri-graph pass is
	    implemented in assembly and does not slow down preprocessing in
	    any noticable fashion, you should not disable tri-graphs unless
	    you need to.
