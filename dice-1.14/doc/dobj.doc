    DOBJ <object_files> [-o outfile] [-nd] [-nc] [-d#]

    DOBJ disassembles object modules AND LIBRARIES into assembly.  DOBJ is
    useful for, say, finding bugs in an assembler.  Most DICE users will
    use DOBJ to browse through libraries and object modules, and perhaps to
    check DAS optimizations... for example, branch optimizations will show
    up in disassembled object modules that are not otherwise apparent by
    looking at assembly output (DCC -a).

    DOBJ generates output to the console unless the -o option is used.	The
    -d option is for debugging the DOBJ program itself and not normally
    used.

	-o filename	redirect output

	-d[#]		set debug level

	-nd		do not show actual data, only display symbol
			names

	-nc		do not disassemble actual code, only display symbol
			names

    DOBJ will replace hunk/offset references with symbol names when possible
    to yield a more readable output, and interprets each hunk according to
    its type (CODE, DATA, or BSS).

    There is NO limit to the size of the object file that may be
    disassembled, but it should be noted that DOBJ can take a while to
    resolve a large object file's symbols so be patient.  DOBJ does not
    take up much memory run-time, even when disassembling large object
    modules.

WARNING
    DOBJ does not understand all 68000 instructions.  It does not
    understand any 68020/030 instructions yet.
