			PRINTER DRIVER EXAMPLE README

    Enclosed is example printer driver code for DICE.  Essentially it
    is the same as commodore printer driver code with the following
    exceptions:

    * uses a DICE startup for Init/Expunge which means that you can use
      DICE's auto-library open/close capability (i.e. not have to
      manually open intuition.library, graphics.library, etc...)

    * uses the small-data model, meaning that all interface functions
      are qualified with __geta4

    Also, const data declarations are used for read-only data whenever
    possible to reduce data segment overhead.
