$VER: Known_Buglist 3.0 (1.20.94)

No product of any reasonable complexity is completely without problems.
If someone were to fix every last item/suggestion/enhancement then nothing
would be ever released.  We hope to have achieved the balance between what
must be fixed verses what would be nice to eventually address.

The following enhancements/suggestions/bugs still remain in the latest version
of DICE.  We do not believe that their presense impares the final product, but
certainly they are on our list to be addressed in time.
