			  LICENSE FOR DICE


    1.	COPYRIGHT:	These programs and the related documentation
	are copyrighted.  You may not use, copy, modify, or transfer the
	programs or documentation or any copy except as expressly provided
	in this agreement

    2.	LICENSE:	You have the non-exclusive right to use any
	enclosed program only on a single computer.  You may load the
	program into your computer's temporary memory (RAM).  You may
	physically transfer the program from one computer to another
	provided that the program is used on only one computer at a time.
	You may not electronically transfer the program or accompanying
	documentation to another person over a network.  You may not
	distribute copies of the program or accompanying documentation to
	others. You may not decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer,
	modify or translate the program.

	All other rights and uses not specifically granted in this license
	relating to items created by the author of DICE are reserved by the
	author of DICE.  All other rights and uses not specifically granted
	in this license relating to items created by Commodore are reserved
	by Commodore.	Where clarification is required of the above
	paragraph, the author of DICE shall decide the clarification. Where
	such clarification is deemed illegal, the latter sentence will be
	withdrawn from this license.

    3.	BACKUP-UP AND TRANSFER: You may make any number of physical backups
	of the program and documentation provided the backups remain in your
	immediate possession.  You must reproduce and include the copyright
	notice on any backup copy.  You may transfer and license the product
	to another party only if the other party agrees to the terms and
	conditions of this Agreement and completes and returns a registration
	card to the author of DICE.  If you transfer the program you must at
	the same time transfer the documentation and back-up copies or
	transfer the documentation and destroy the backup copies.

    4.	TERMS:	This license is effective until terminated.  You may
	terminate it by destroying the program and documentation and all
	copies thereof.  This license will also terminate if you fail to
	comply with any term or condition of this Agreement.  You agree
	upon such termination to destroy all copies of the program and
	documentation.

    5.	EXCEPTIONS:  Exceptions to the LICENSE (2) exist ONLY for the
	FreeWare version of DICE released by the author to public
	networks.  THE VERSIONS OF DICE SENT TO USERS BY PHYSICAL MAIL OR
	RELEASED THROUGH A DISTRIBUTOR ARE NOT FREEWARE AND ALL CONTRACT
	PROVISIONS APPLY!  In plain english, you cannot redistribute any
	DICE received through the mail unless my explicit, written
	permission is given (and will be given only if I am sending you
	the FreeWare version via normal mail).

	For the FREEWARE VERSION, obtained via public networks ONLY, and
	not containing ANY COMMODORE CREATED FILES, the distribution may be
	redistributed to other public networks or individuals only in
	whole.

    6.	PROGRAM DISCLAIMER: THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT
	WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
	BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
	RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF ANY PROGRAM IS ASSUMED BY YOU.  Should
	the program prove defective, you (and not Commodore or its dealers
	or the author of DICE) assume the entire cost of all necessary
	servicing, repair, or correction.  Further, neither Commodore nor
	the author of DICE warrants, guarantees, or makes any
	representations regarding the use of, or the results of the use of,
	the program in terms of corrections, accuracy, reliability,
	currentness, or otherwise; and you rely on the program and results
	solely at your own risk.

    7.	DISKETTE LIMITED WARRANTY:  The author of DICE warrents to the
	original license that the diskette(s) on which the program is
	recorded shall be free from defects in material and workmanship
	only for a period of one 6 months from the date of original
	purchase.  If a defect covered by this warranty occurs during
	this 6 month warranty period, and it is returned to the dealer
	from whom it was purchased not later than five (5) days of the end
	of such 6 month period, the dealer shall, at the dealer's option,
	either repair or replace the diskette.

	The above warranty is exclusive and in lieu of all other
	warranties, express or implied (other than those warranties implied
	by state law).	All state statutory implied warranties, including,
	but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability or fitness
	for a particular purpose shall be limited to a period of 6 months
	from the date of your original purchase.  No warranties, either
	express or implied, will apply after this period.

    8.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  COMMODORE AND THE AUTHOR OF DICE's LIABILITY
	IS LIMITED SOLELY TO THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECTIVE
	PRODUCT, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, AND SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT INCLUDE
	DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR BENEFITS OR
	OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL COSTS, EXPENSES OR DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DATA OR INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE
	LOST OR RENDERED INACCURATE, EVEN IF THE AUTHOR OF DICE AND/OR
	COMMODORE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	Some states do now allow a limitation on how long an implied
	warranty lasts, or limitation of incidental or consequential
	damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to
	you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may
	also have other rights which vary from state to state.

    9.	MISCELLANEOUS:	This agreement represents the entire understanding
	regarding the programs and related documentation, and supersedes
	any prior purchase order, communications or representations.  This
	agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an
	officer of Commodore (when related to Commodore specific files in
	the distribution) or by a written amendment signed by the author of
	DICE (when related to all other files in the distribution).  If any
	provision of the agreement shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for
	any reason, unenforceable it shall be deemed separate from, and
	shall in no way affect the validity and enforceability of the
	remaining provisions of the agreement.

	This license agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United
	States of America.

    10. The program License Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
	Commodore-Amiga, Inc, its parent, and all affiliated companies
	thereof with exception to DICE specific programs and documentation,
	which shall inure to the benefit of the author of DICE.
